# predicting-employee-turnover-with-data-analysis
## Description
A complete data analysis project in which employee turnover for a fictional company is predicted and analyzed using Python. For this analysis, EDA, decision trees, random forests, feature engenieering, and other data science topics are applied to a study case.

## Why should you care?
The retention of good employees is a critical task for any company, but the multitude of factors that lead someone to leave a job position make such a situation hard to analyze via simple inspections or, even worse, "gut feeling". To overcome such limitations and achieve an efficient and analytically correct view of employee turnover, data analysis is used.

## Requirements and quick start
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

**Data Manipulation**
- numpy
- pandas

**Data Visualization**
- matplotlib
- seaborn

**Data Modeling**
- xgboost
- scikit-learn

**Saving Models**
- pickle
